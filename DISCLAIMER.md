# Legal Disclaimer

**READ THIS CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE**

## Not Legal Advice

This software (the "Tool") is provided for **informational and research purposes only**. It does **NOT** constitute professional legal advice, and must not be relied upon as a substitute for professional legal counsel.

### What This Means

- **No Attorney-Client Relationship**: Use of this Tool does not create an attorney-client relationship (Mandatsverhältnis)
- **No Professional Responsibility**: The authors and contributors assume no professional responsibility for decisions made based on information from this Tool
- **Verification Required**: ALL legal information, citations, and conclusions must be independently verified with official sources and qualified legal professionals before being relied upon

## Professional Use Warnings

### For Legal Professionals

If you are a lawyer (Rechtsanwalt/Rechtsanwältin), legal researcher, or other legal professional:

- **Malpractice Risk**: Relying on unverified information from this Tool in professional legal work may constitute professional malpractice (Berufshaftung)
- **Professional Obligations**: You remain solely responsible for verifying all citations, statutes, and legal positions before advising clients or filing documents
- **Professional Rules**: Members of the Bundesrechtsanwaltskammer (BRAK) and regional bar chambers (Rechtsanwaltskammern) must comply with applicable professional conduct rules (Berufsordnung für Rechtsanwälte, BORA) when using AI tools
- **Client Disclosure**: Consider whether professional ethics rules (berufsrechtliche Pflichten) require disclosing AI tool use to clients

### Duty of Independent Verification

**YOU MUST VERIFY EVERYTHING.** Do not cite, quote, or rely on any provision, case law, or legal interpretation from this Tool without:

1. Checking the official source (Gesetze im Internet — gesetze-im-internet.de, or the Bundesgesetzblatt — BGBl)
2. Verifying the provision is currently in force (geltende Fassung) and has not been amended
3. Reading the full context of cited provisions
4. Consulting case law (Rechtsprechung) and legislative materials (Gesetzesmaterialien, Bundestagsdrucksachen) for interpretation
5. Considering how recent legal developments may affect the matter

## Data Authority and Limitations

### Source Authority

This Tool aggregates data from official German legal databases. However:

| Source Type | Authority Level | Use Case |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Gesetze im Internet (gesetze-im-internet.de)** | Authoritative | Federal statute text (primary reference) |
| **Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl)** | Authoritative (promulgation) | Official publication of laws and amendments |
| **Community/open-data sources** | Supplementary | Cross-references, metadata (verify independently) |
| **EUR-Lex / treaty databases** | Authoritative for EU/international law | EU directives, regulations, international obligations |

**CRITICAL**: Community-maintained resources are **NOT** official government publications. While generally reliable, they may contain transcription errors, outdated information, or incomplete coverage. Note that state-level legislation (Landesrecht) may not be covered.

### Commercial Legal Databases

For professional legal work, **always cross-check with commercial legal databases** such as:

- Beck-Online, Juris, LexisNexis Germany (LexisNexis Recht)

These services provide editorial oversight, comprehensive commentary (Kommentierungen), and professional-grade currency guarantees that this Tool **cannot** provide.

## Currency and Staleness

### No Real-Time Updates

- Database updates are **manual** and may lag official publications by **weeks or months**
- German law changes continuously through new statutes (Gesetze), amendments (Änderungsgesetze), and court decisions (Urteile, Beschlüsse)
- **Last-updated timestamps** in tool responses indicate data age, but should be treated as unreliable

### Staleness Warnings

The Tool includes staleness warnings when data is >30 days old. **These warnings are not exhaustive**:

- Even "fresh" data may be outdated if recent amendments were published in the Bundesgesetzblatt (BGBl)
- Staleness warnings do not guarantee completeness or accuracy
- Always check official sources for the current legal position (geltende Rechtslage)

### Amendments and Repeals

- A provision marked "in force" may have been:
  - Amended (geändert) after the last database update
  - Repealed (aufgehoben) but not yet removed from the database
  - Subject to transitional rules (Übergangsvorschriften) affecting its applicability
- The Tool does **NOT** automatically track amendments in real-time

## Coverage Gaps

### What's Missing

This Tool does **NOT** include:

1. **Complete case law** -- Coverage of BGH, BVerfG, BVerwG, BAG, BSG, BFH, and lower court decisions is limited; do not rely solely on this for case law research (Rechtsprechungsrecherche)
2. **State-level legislation** -- Landesrecht (legislation of the 16 Bundesländer) is not systematically covered
3. **Historical statute versions** -- Limited availability of historical provision wording (Fassungsvergleich)
4. **Legal commentary** -- No editorial Kommentare (e.g., Palandt/Grüneberg, Münchener Kommentar), academic literature (Schrifttum), or practice guides
5. **Unpublished decisions** -- Lower court decisions and administrative rulings (Verwaltungsakte) largely absent
6. **Full legislative history** -- Limited coverage of Bundestagsdrucksachen, Ausschussberichte, and Gesetzesmaterialien

### Impact on Professional Use

These gaps mean:

- **Incomplete Legal Research**: Tool results are inherently incomplete and may miss critical authorities
- **Context Missing**: Without Kommentierung and Gesetzesmaterialien, interpretation may be incorrect
- **International Law Blind Spots**: Cannot fully assess EU law obligations or international treaty compliance
- **Federal Gap**: Missing Landesrecht means many practice areas (e.g., police law, building law, education law) are not adequately covered

## No Warranties

### "AS IS" -- No Guarantees

Per the Apache 2.0 license (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)):

- **NO WARRANTY OF ACCURACY**: Data may contain errors, omissions, or outdated information
- **NO WARRANTY OF COMPLETENESS**: Searches may miss relevant provisions or cases

## AI-Generated Content

This Tool uses **algorithmic search and ranking** that may:

- Return irrelevant or misleading results

- Rank less relevant provisions higher than more relevant ones
- Make errors in parsing, citation formatting, or cross-referencing

**Human review is MANDATORY** before relying on any AI-generated search results or analysis.

## EU AI Act Compliance

This Tool is a **general-purpose AI system** under the EU AI Act. It is NOT a high-risk "administration of justice" system (which applies to AI used by courts and prosecutors for case outcomes).

### Transparency Obligations (Article 50, 52)

- **AI Disclosure**: This Tool uses AI/algorithmic methods for search and ranking
- **User Awareness**: Users are notified that results are AI-generated and require verification

## Professional Ethics Considerations

### Confidentiality

- See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) for detailed confidentiality considerations
- **Query Data**: Queries made through the Claude API may be logged by Anthropic (subject to their privacy policy)
- **Client Information**: Do not include client names, case-specific details, or confidential information in queries
- **Sensitive Matters**: For privileged legal matters (Verschwiegenheitspflicht), consider on-premise deployment

Using this Tool does not reduce your professional obligations to:

- Exercise independent legal judgment (eigenverantwortliche Prüfung)
- Conduct thorough legal research using authoritative sources
- Stay current with legal developments
- Provide competent representation (sorgfältige Mandatsbearbeitung)

## Recommended Workflow for Professional Use

1. **Initial Research**: Use Tool for preliminary research and hypothesis generation
2. **Official Verification**: Cross-check ALL results with official sources (Gesetze im Internet — gesetze-im-internet.de)
3. **Commercial Databases**: Use professional legal databases (Beck-Online, Juris, LexisNexis Germany) for authoritative, annotated versions
4. **Professional Judgment**: Apply independent legal analysis and professional judgment
5. **Document Sources**: Cite official sources in legal work, not this Tool
6. **Update Check**: Before finalizing legal work, check for recent amendments and decisions
